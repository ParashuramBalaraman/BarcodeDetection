# BarcodeDetection
Takes an image of an item with a barcode on it, and detects the barcode through converting the image to greyscale, finding the absolute gradient, applying a gaussian filter an appropraite numnber of times, computing the threshold, and diluting and eroding the greyscale image. It then draws a box around the barcode on the original image. 

My work can be found under teh Students workl section where I have numbered the steps.
